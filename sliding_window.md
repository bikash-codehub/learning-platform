# Sliding Window Technique

The sliding window algorithm is commonly used for solving problems related to arrays or strings where you need to find a subset that satisfies certain conditions.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Define the Window Boundaries**
   - Start with two pointers, typically called `start` and `end`, that mark the boundaries of the current window.
2. **Expand the Window**
   - Move the `end` pointer to include new elements until the window meets the desired condition.
3. **Process the Current Window**
   - Once the window satisfies the condition, record or update results based on the contents of the window.
4. **Shrink the Window**
   - Move the `start` pointer forward to reduce the window size when it no longer meets the requirement or when you want to look for smaller windows.
5. **Repeat**
   - Continue expanding and shrinking until the `end` pointer reaches the end of the data structure.

This approach keeps computations efficient because each element is visited at most twice, once by `end` and once by `start`.
